				# entries:
				#
				#   [portno] (mandatory)
				#   The OpenFlow port number assigned by the datapath element to 
				#   a specific port.
				#
				#   [pvid] (optional)
				#   The port VID assigned to this port. This VID is assigned to all
				#   untagged frames received on the specific port.

				# [ethernet] (optional)
				#
				# Predefined endpoints for layer (n+1) Ethernet communication.
				# A list of group entries defining Ethernet endpoints for higher layer
				# communication (e.g. IPv4/v6). Each Ethernet endpoint is attached to 
				# a certain VID:mac-address combination. baseboxd creates tap-devices
				# for each endpoint defined, so make sure to choose unique devnames.
				#
				#   [devname] (mandatory)
				#   Name assigned to the new Ethernet endpoint and port created in Linux.
				#
				#   [vid] (optional)
				#   The VLAN identifier assigned to this endpoint, i.e. packets sent
				#   via this interface will enter the specified VLAN. If no vid parameter
				#   is specified, the default port VID defined for this datapath element
				#   will be used.
				#
				#   [hwaddr] (mandatory)
				#   MAC address assigned to this Ethernet endpoint. Arbitrary values 
				#   may be chosen for the link layer address, but should fulfill
				#   constraints and regulations defined by IANA/IEEE/EUI48 ;)

		#

		# and routes. baseboxd will listen to the netlink interface and map
		# addresses and routes to appropriate OpenFlow flow table entries
		# on the OpenFlow datapath element.
		#
		# User plane traffic will be directly switched in the datapath 
		# element, while control plane traffic (e.g., ARP/ICMP, etc.) will 
		# be escalated to the Linux kernel for further handling.
